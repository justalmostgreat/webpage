		<h1>Service</h1>
			
			<p>
			Service has always been a big part of my life. I often find great friends and feel great after volunteer work. During my time in college, I've been fotunate to be a part of SLOT, Student Leaders of Tomorrow. I served as one of the mentors within the conference. The position consisted of teaching and initiating discussion with high school students about the fundamentals of leadership and building on their strengths.

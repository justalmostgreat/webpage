			<p>
			Service has always been a big part of my life. I often find great friends and feel great after volunteer work. During my time in college, 
			I've been fotunate to be a part of <a href="https://tamuslotlogistics.wixsite.com/mysite?fbclid=IwAR1Lx9pE6SYxjQ-1n8nyP7Zkl0Y2QYMANJetDpA-XwxrR_4olE4SswQsmiU">SLOT</a>, Student Leaders of Tomorrow. I served as one of the mentors 
			within the conference. The position consisted of teaching and initiating 
			discussion with high school students about the fundamentals of leadership and 
			building on their strengths. I'm also a part of the <a href="https://www.aggiephidelt.com/">Phi Delta Theta</a> Brotherhood,
			where I help hold events for charity and the community.

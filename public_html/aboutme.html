			<h1>About me</h1>
			
			<p>
			I study computer science with minors in Business and Cybersecurity. Some of my interests within 
			my field are penetration testing, data science and mobile development. I also enjoy <a href="https://www.imleagues.com/spa/league/269dd9999d6346a38a54326cf5b51779/home#leaguename">soccer</a>, <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/">investing</a>, and basketball in my free time.

				I was born in South India, and grew up there until I was 9 years old. Then, my family relocated to 
				America. The first place we stayed in the States was the Bay area near San Francisco. 
				Then, we moved to Minnesota. It was a pretty big change from the warm weather I was 
				used to. We finally ended up settling in Austin, TX. I went to Harmony School of Science
				for most of my schooling there and graduated from <a href="http://www.pfisd.net/site/Default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&PageID=1&ViewID=7b97f7ed-8e5e-4120-848f-a8b4987d588f&FlexDataID=15930">Hendrickson High School.</a>.

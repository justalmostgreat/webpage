			<h1>About me</h1>
			
			<p>
			I study computer science with minors in Business and Cybersecurity. Some of my interests within my field are penetration testing, data science and mobile development. I also enjoy soccer, investing, and basketball in my free time.

				I was born in South India, and grew up there until I was 9 years old. Then, my family relocated to America. The first place we stayed in the States was the Bay area near San Francisco. Then, we moved to Minnesota. It was a pretty big change from the warm weather I was used to. We finally ended up settling in Austin, TX. I went to Harmony for most of my schooling there and graduated from Hendrickson High School.

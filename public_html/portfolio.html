	I am a student at Texas A&M pursuing Computer Science and I enjoy writing code for programs. My coursework and campus involvement have prepared me well for this position. I have researched into the position and am sure that I’d be a great fit into this team at Greenway Health.
Important experiences and skills I bring to the position include:
A strong all around foundation. I have experience in IT and I have learned all phases of collaborative software development. Additionally, I have worked with computers for most of my academic career and took part in activities such as Robotics, Science Olympiad, and Hackathons. I love to learn through teamwork, and understand the importance of collaboration. 
Relevant Coursework completed. I have taken classes that exposed me to a lot of programming such as Operating Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, etc. I also have minors in Business and Cyber security. 
Excellent Interpersonal Communication and Social Skills. I have effectively worked in various groups. In my position as a student researcher, I worked in a formal environment to produce work. As a mentor in Student Leaders of Tomorrow, I worked in more of a teacher's role to explain the aspects of leadership to High School students. In my Engineering group, I worked in an informal setting to achieve our goal. In addition, I have debate and public speaking experience.
​I would be thrilled to work and grow in this position, and I welcome the opportunity to tell you how my skills and ideas can benefit the company. I look forward to working and am confident that I can add to the team. I can be reached at (512) 587-6628 or lagisettyjy@gmail.com.

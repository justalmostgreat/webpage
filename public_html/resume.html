	<p> I came into <a href="https://tamu.edu/">college</a> planning on majoring in Aerospace Engineering. I knew I had an affinity for programming,
	however, space exploration excited me and I thought my interests lay with aerospace.
	Throughout my freshman year, I found myself getting more and more comfortable with 
	programming due to the general engineering courses and intro to programming classes. I also had the realization that computer
	science was a tremendously versatile field. I understood that I can still be involved in the space exploration industry with 
	computer science skills.</p>
	
	<p>
	Throughout my past two years in the major, I have been able to build my skills in software and application development.
	Other than the very low level memory allocation type assignments / projects, I have found almost all of the other 
	development tasks very pleasant and exciting. Due to this interest, I've taken part in hackathons like 
	<a href="https://tamuhack.com/">TAMUhack</a>, <a href="https://hacktx.com/">hackTX</a>, and <a href="https://www.hackutd.co/">hackUTD</a>
	all over the state to improve my skill and knowledge of the life cycle. I've been able to meet some great people and work on exciting 
	projects due to these great events. I plan on participating in a lot more. Currently a friend and I are working on a
	project called autofill++, which will aim to make job and internship applications easier to finish.
	
	</p>
	
	<p> A.I and Robotics are my key areas of interest because I eventually want to work 
	on <a href="https://futurism.com/von-neumann-probe">self-replicating space probes</a>. I believe that artificially
	intelligent systems will be the future of space exploration. They can expand humanityâ€™s scope of the 
	universe at literally an exponential rate at times and will lead to less human lives
	at risk. I also understand that there may not be many opportunities to work on such 
	projects, which is why I intend to study Business and pursue one of other interests financial technology as well. </p>
